# Lab 2


## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab #2 was to delve into more information of the second component of an information system, the software. When looking at software, several topics are important such as how the computer interprets the data, as it can be represented in different bases and how a program can be either interpreted(such as Python) or compiled. Additionally, the lab covered different types of software programs and how virtualization is a process to make servers more efficient, along with how expertise in software areas can lead to jobs and internships.

## Data Representation
### Numeric Conversions
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimals is the base (how many digits can take the spot of one space). Decimal is also called base 10, meaning that there are 10 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) that can be in one place, the same is for binary but it is base 2 with only 2 digits(0,1). Hexadecimal works similarly as it is base 16, meaning it has 16 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff is composed of AB red (which is 171 Red in decimal), 00 Green (0 green in decimal), and FF Blue (255 blue in decimal). This means that it is composed of red and blue, and there is more blue than there is red; and in composition this creates "pure violet". The closest websafe color is #9900ff, which also appears as violet. The color #ab00ff could be problematic in older computers when trying to access the site or somewhat old mobile phones as these devices can only display the 216 websafe colors, and that doesn't inclue #ab00ff. However, for the most part, users would not be affected by the use of #ab00ff. The main factor that needs to be considered is the audience (are they going to be using old browsers? If so, they should use the websafe colors), the contrast between the color the background and foreground, and the size of the font

## Software
**Application software** - The role of application software is used to accomplish a goal, and they are usually classified into one of several groups: Killer apps (an app that someone buys the hardware so that they can have the app), productivity apps (such as Microsoft Suite), or other. An example of an application software is PowerPoint by Microsoft.
**Utility Software** - The role of utility software is to allow you to fix, optimize, or modify your computer. An example of an utility software is CCleaner, which removes unused files and settings on the hard drive to make the computer run quicker, and thus it is optimizing the computer.
**Operating System Software** - The role of operating system software is managing all of the programs on a computer, managing hardware resources, user-interface components, and having a platform that code can be written on. An example of an operating system software is iOS by Apple on its mobile devices.
**ERP** - ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, is a type of software application that uses a central database in order to organize information within a large company. An example of an ERP is Oracle, which is a company that sells a software application that helps to integrate cloud applications and database software and technology.
**Virtualization** - The purpose of virtualization is to emulate several devices by using only one computer, allowing companies to run more than one virtual system. This is different from clud computing because cloud computing is where data and applications are stored on the Internet instead of installed on a computer, whereas virtualization is running more than one system from a device in order to reduce costs in hardware.

## Virtualization
Problems such as not using a server to its full potential, too high costs of hardware and cooling, and only being able to run one task on one server are solved with virtualization. In virtualization, a hypervisor seperates the physical resources from the virtual environment, meaning that they divide up physical resources amoung the  virtual machines.

The difference between cloud computing and virtualization is that virtualization makes several virtual machines and divides resources between them, but cloud computing takes this to an extra level and pools virtual machines and adds extra automation and administration in order to make it accessable through other computers and easily scalable. In general, virtualization is a technology used to create simulated environments, whereas cloud computing is a method that allows on-demand use from other computers. A network administrator can move from virtualization to cloud computing by pooling the virtual resources together, creaating an automated management system, and using a system that allows control from other devices, such as Red Hat.

## Python
Pseudocode is code that has minimal or limited syntax, meaning that you can focus more on what the code needs to do and solve rather than the syntax in order to make it run correctly. Python is considered closer to pseudocode as it has very little syntax and what syntax there is is very easy to learn. Python also is an interpreted coding language, meaningt that it doesn't need to be compiled and converted to binary as a compiled language does. Instead, Python converts the code into bytecodes and then turns it into the native computer language and runs it, thus it is called "interpreted", rather than "compiled" where it is compiled and converted into binary  in order to run the code.

## Career Exploration
### College Central
Looking through the internships in the College Central, what I realized was that there are quite a few internships that require people with technology skills. I also realized that many of the internships require a bachelor's degree. 
### Certifications
I looked at the Cisco certification, and what I learned from their website is that Cisco certified employees are more likely to be more efficient and better at using technology in order to help customers. There are also several different "stages" of certifications that Cisco offers, such as Entry, Associate, Professional, and Expert. I believe that this method allows for more flexibility and the website displayed the course certifications needed to get to each level. 
### Certificates and Degrees
After exploring the Tri-C certificates on their website, one certificate that I thought was interesting was the "Short-Term Certificate in Mobile Application Developement". This certificate is based on designing, developing, and testing mobile applications and teaches students how to make apps and how to prepare to have a job in mobile app development.
### Co-ops / Internships
What you need to do in order to be "co-op ready" is to go through the co-op orientation process from the Career Center on the Tri-C website, create/update a resume, meet with a Employer Relations Specialist in order to apply for and participate in a co-op, and finally, sign the "Cooperative Education Agreement" form. Co-ops, internships, and job shadowing are all great ways to get experience in a certain job field and allow you to see if that is what you want to major in and later have a job in that field.
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
The organization I chose was the CCDC, also known as the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, which is a competition formed by an organization that is attempting to provide students with a controlled environment in which they try to protect a corporate network infrastructure. The CCDC allows students to put what they have learned in classrooms into the real world and allows them to work in teams to foster collaboration.

## Conclusion
During this lab, I learned some of the basics about the software that makes our everyday interactions with technology possible.  I did have some difficulty with the Virtual Machine creation, but I corresponded with Professor Tamerlano and was able to resolve the issue with her help. Finally, I really enjoyed starting to learn how Python works and am looking forward to learning how to use it more in the following weeks.
