## Data Representation
### Numeric Conversions
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimals is the base (how many digits can take the spot of one space). Decimal is also called base 10, meaning that there are 10 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) that can be in one place, the same is for binary but it is base 2 with only 2 digits(0,1). Hexadecimal works similarly as it is base 16, meaning it has 16 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff is composed of AB red (which is 171 Red in decimal), 00 Green (0 green in decimal), and FF Blue (255 blue in decimal). This means that it is composed of red and blue, and there is more blue than there is red; and in composition this creates "pure violet". The closest websafe color is #9900ff, which also appears as violet. The color #ab00ff could be problematic in older computers when trying to access the site or somewhat old mobile phones as these devices can only display the 216 websafe colors, and that doesn't inclue #ab00ff. However, for the most part, users would not be affected by the use of #ab00ff. The main factor that needs to be considered is the audience (are they going to be using old browsers? If so, they should use the websafe colors), the contrast between the color the background and foreground, and the size of the font

## Software
**Application software** - The role of application software is used to accomplish a goal, and they are usually classified into one of several groups: Killer apps (an app that someone buys the hardware so that they can have the app), productivity apps (such as Microsoft Suite), or other. An example of an application software is PowerPoint by Microsoft.
**Utility Software** - The role of utility software is to allow you to fix, optimize, or modify your computer. An example of an utility software is CCleaner, which removes unused files and settings on the hard drive to make the computer run quicker, and thus it is optimizing the computer.
**Operating System Software** - The role of operating system software is managing all of the programs on a computer, managing hardware resources, user-interface components, and having a platform that code can be written on. An example of an operating system software is iOS by Apple on its mobile devices.
**ERP** - ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, is a type of software application that uses a central database in order to organize information within a large company. An example of an ERP is Oracle, which is a company that sells a software application that helps to integrate cloud applications and database software and technology.
**Virtualization** - The purpose of virtualization is to emulate several devices by using only one computer, allowing companies to run more than one virtual system. This is different from clud computing because cloud computing is where data and applications are stored on the Internet instead of installed on a computer, whereas virtualization is running more than one system from a device in order to reduce costs in hardware.
