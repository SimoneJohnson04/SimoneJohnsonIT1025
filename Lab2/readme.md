## Data Representation
### Numeric Conversions
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimals is the base (how many digits can take the spot of one space). Decimal is also called base 10, meaning that there are 10 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) that can be in one place, the same is for binary but it is base 2 with only 2 digits(0,1). Hexadecimal works similarly as it is base 16, meaning it has 16 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff is composed of AB red (which is 171 Red in decimal), 00 Green (0 green in decimal), and FF Blue (255 blue in decimal). This means that it is composed of red and blue, and there is more blue than there is red; and in composition this creates "pure violet". The closest websafe color is #9900ff, which also appears as violet. The color #ab00ff could be problematic in older computers when trying to access the site or somewhat old mobile phones as these devices can only display the 216 websafe colors, and that doesn't inclue #ab00ff. However, for the most part, users would not be affected by the use of #ab00ff. The main factor that needs to be considered is the audience (are they going to be using old browsers? If so, they should use the websafe colors), the contrast between the color the background and foreground, and the size of the font
