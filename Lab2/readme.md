## Data Representation
### Numeric Conversions
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimals is the base (how many digits can take the spot of one space). Decimal is also called base 10, meaning that there are 10 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) that can be in one place, the same is for binary but it is base 2 with only 2 digits(0,1). Hexadecimal works similarly as it is base 16, meaning it has 16 different digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).
