# Lab 1


## Executive Summary
The purpose of this week's lab was to understand of how the IT1025 course will be proceeding, along with developing a familiarity with the basics of using GitHub and learning how GitHub can be used both in this course and for future projects and job applications. Additionally, in this lab the goal was to grasp the idea of an information system and be able to identify the fundamental parts that make up an information system. Furthermore, a more indepth study of the first part of an information system, the hardware component, was started in this lab.


## Information System Components  
An example of an information system that I used just a few hours ago is a Google Forms survey in order to conduct an election (for marching band). The system allowed users to input their votes for one canidate per position and then processed the data in order to display it easily for the person conducting the election.
**Hardware** - The hardware in this voting system is the computers, phones, keyboards, mice, and tablets that people used to vote and access the results.
**Software** - Two components of software in the information system of this voting process are the operating system and the application software. The operating system  could be ChromeOS, which Chromebooks use, Apple iOS which is used by iPhones, or Google Andriod for Andriod phones. The application software is Google Forms, created by Google.
**Data** - The data in this information system is the votes for each candidate, as the data that the survey is collecting is the votes in order to analyze the results.
**People** - The people in this infomation system are the person who created the Google Form, and the developers, testers, analysts, and everyone else behind the creation of the Google Form application, along with all of the people who filled out the Google Form.
**Processes** - The processes in this information system are the collection and compilation of the responses by the application (Google Forms) and the utilization of that information in order to determine the results of the election and this allows the users to get the information they need from the information system in order to use it to promote the correct candidate.


## GitHub  
### Client-Server Architecture  
GitHub is a "Client-Server" archeticture because it has the user log on and connect to the server and the computer that the user is considered the client and it communicates with the server. A client-side application is one that the action is taking place on the client or user's computer, as opposed to server-side which are actions on the web server. One action that is done client-side is the interpretation of mark-up languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS, whereas an action such as data storage or interpretation of other programming languages like Java, Ruby, or Python is usually done on the server-side. What GitHub Desktop does to the client-server arceticture is that the client is downloaded onto the computer as an application rather than being on a website, but both need to communicate with the server.
### Cloud Computing
"Cloud computing" is computer services such as servers, storage, analytics, and databases being sent to the client's computer by way the "cloud" or internet. GitHub is considered "cloud computing" because it provides storage for information and allows the client's computer to connect to the server and potentially download software. An example of another "cloud computing" environment I use is Google Drive as it uses servers in order to deliver information and store information for the client.


## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
**Latency vs. Transfer Rates** - The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive is that latency is the speed at which it spins the disc to find the location of the data, whereas the transfer rate is the speed at which the data is transfered to and from the disk media. Therefore, both affect the speed of information being transfered, but latency is the speed of getting to the data versus transfer is the speed of sending the data. 
**SSD**, or Solid State Drives, have the same function as hard drives, storage of information and data, but they are newer and have a different way of storing and retrieving the information that is faster and more reliable than hard drives. Solid state drives do not use the spinning platters or moving heads in order to store and retrieve data, rather, they use flash memory and store data in the memory by splitting it into word length pieces.
**RAM** - Increasing RAM allows the computer to run faster as it is less likely to not be able to hold all of the data, meaning that it is less likely to need to use the slower path of switching data in and out of the hard drive in order to complete the actions needed. Therefore, by increasing the about of RAM memory, more data is loaded into the RAM which is faster than the hard drive and thus doesn't need to access the hard drive as much, so it will be faster.
**Data Paths** - The differnce between 64 and 32 bit data paths is the number of bits which they can transfer per 1 clock cycle, as 64 bit data paths like ones used in DIMMs can transfer 64 bits in 1 clock cycle, whereas 32 bit data paths like ones in SIMMs can only transfer 32 bits of data in 1 clock cycle.
### ALU and the Control Unit
The interaction of the control unit and the ALU, or Arithmetic Logic Unit, is that the ALU is what performs mathematical operations in the CPU and the control unit recieves instructions from RAM and then breaks the instructions down for the ALU and other components. More specifically, the control unit recieves an instruction from RAM, then tells the ALU what type of operation to do with input A and B, and the ALU responds with the output of the operation or a flag which helps the control unit continue with operations based on the output or flag. The ALU needs the control unit to turn on the set wire in order to store the output in a register, and the control unit turns on the enable wire to allow the register to output the number it saved inside. Therefore, it is clear that the ALU is the component that performs the mathematical operation and the control unit is what sends the ALU instructions and recieves the result of the ALU's operation.
### CPU, Input & Output
**CPU** - The CPU in a self-check out is most likely an Intel microprocessor in the  computer (central) part of the self-check out at the grocery. 
**Input** - The input from the self-check out at the grocery is the scanner, the touchpad (for the signature), and the card slot reader. 
**Output** - The output from the self-check out would be the screen on which the items and total cost is displayed. Anotehr output could be the touchpad that also shows information after the items are processed. 
### Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table shows what the circuit comparer outputs depending on what is put into the system, showing all of the possible inputs and their resulting outputs. A NAND gate is similar in mechanism to the AND gate, however, when both inputs in the NAND gate are on, the output is off; in opposition to an AND gate where if both inputs are on, the output is on. Essentially what the NAND gate is it does the opposite of whatever the AND gate does, if the AND gate is 1, the NAND gate is 0, if the AND gate is 0, the NAND gate is 1. See the tables below for further clarification:

**AND Truth Table**           
| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |              
| ------- | ------- | ------ |              
|    0    |    0    |    0   |              
|    0    |    1    |    0   |              
|    1    |    0    |    0   |              
|    1    |    1    |    1   |              

**NAND Truth Table**
| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
|    0    |    0    |    1   |
|    0    |    1    |    1   |
|    1    |    0    |    1   |
|    1    |    1    |    0   |
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The IEEE, also known as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, is a group of people who work in electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology areas. The purpose of IEEE is to promote the development of technology and innovations in order to benefit human lives. The importance of ethics in design is that as AI technology increases and becomes more prevalent in our world, AI will most likely shape and affect our lives and thus ethics in the development and design is important because of how AI will affect us in the future. Furthemore, AI and code can and will affect people for the better or for the worse, and thus it is important to keep ethics in mind while designing and programming.


## Conclusion 
During this lab, I learned a lot about information systems and their components, many specifics about the hardware components of information systems, and about the ethics involved in current development and design of technology. I also learned how to use GitHub, which is very beneficial because I have been wanting to start using GitHub for sharing programs before this course but wasn't sure of how to start using it before this. I did have some trouble in this lab figuring out how to format tables in GitHub, but figured it out using the Markdown Cheat-Sheet. Finally, I have found learning about the history of computers and how they work interesting and can't wait to understand more!
