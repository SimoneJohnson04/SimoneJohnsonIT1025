### Executive Summary
Executive summary stuff (summary as if explaining it to a team)

### Information System Components  
An example of an information system that I used just a few hours ago is a Google Forms survey in order to conduct an election (for marching band). The system allowed users to input their votes for one canidate per position and then processed the data in order to display it easily for the person conducting the election.
#### Hardware
The hardware in this voting system is the computers, phones, keyboards, mice, and tablets that people used to vote and access the results.
#### Software
Two components of software in the information system of this voting process are the operating system and the application software. The operating system  could be ChromeOS, which Chromebooks use, Apple iOS which is used by iPhones, or Google Andriod for Andriod phones. The application software is Google Forms, created by Google.
#### Data
The data in this information system is the votes for each candidate, as the data that the survey is collecting is the votes in order to analyze the results
#### People
The people in this infomation system are the person who created the Google Form, and the developers, testers, analysts, and everyone else behind the creation of the Google Form application, along with all of the people who filled out the Google Form.
#### Processes
The processes in this information system are the collection and compilation of the responses by the application (Google Forms) and the utilization of that information in order to determine the results of the election and this allows the users to get the information they need from the information system in order to use it to promote the correct candidate.

### GitHub  
#### Client-Server Architecture  
Explain what aspects are accomplished on the client-side vs. the server-side.  Google "GitHub Desktop" and explain what this means within the client-server architecture. 
#### Cloud Computing 
Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use? (hint - anything on the server-side) 

### Conclusion 
Sucesses and challenges in the unit modules
