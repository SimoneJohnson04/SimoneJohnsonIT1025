### Executive Summary
Executive summary stuff (summary as if explaining it to a team)


### Information System Components  
An example of an information system that I used just a few hours ago is a Google Forms survey in order to conduct an election (for marching band). The system allowed users to input their votes for one canidate per position and then processed the data in order to display it easily for the person conducting the election.

**Hardware** - The hardware in this voting system is the computers, phones, keyboards, mice, and tablets that people used to vote and access the results.

**Software** - Two components of software in the information system of this voting process are the operating system and the application software. The operating system  could be ChromeOS, which Chromebooks use, Apple iOS which is used by iPhones, or Google Andriod for Andriod phones. The application software is Google Forms, created by Google.

**Data** - The data in this information system is the votes for each candidate, as the data that the survey is collecting is the votes in order to analyze the results

**People** - The people in this infomation system are the person who created the Google Form, and the developers, testers, analysts, and everyone else behind the creation of the Google Form application, along with all of the people who filled out the Google Form.

**Processes** - The processes in this information system are the collection and compilation of the responses by the application (Google Forms) and the utilization of that information in order to determine the results of the election and this allows the users to get the information they need from the information system in order to use it to promote the correct candidate.


### GitHub  
#### Client-Server Architecture  
GitHub is a "Client-Server" archeticture because it has the user log on and connect to the server and the computer that the user is considered the client and it communicates with the server. A client-side application is one that the action is taking place on the client or user's computer, as opposed to server-side which are actions on the web server. One action that is done client-side is the interpretation of mark-up languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS, whereas an action such as data storage or interpretation of other programming languages like Java, Ruby, or Python is usually done on the server-side. What GitHub Desktop does to the client-server arceticture is that the client is downloaded onto the computer as an application rather than being on a website, but both need to communicate with the server.
#### Cloud Computing
"Cloud computing" is computer services such as servers, storage, analytics, and databases being sent to the client's computer by way the "cloud" or internet. GitHub is considered "cloud computing" because it provides storage for information and allows the client's computer to connect to the server and potentially download software. An example of another "cloud computing" environment I use is Google Drive as it uses servers in order to deliver information and store information for the client.


### Hardware
#### Hard Drives and Memory
The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive is that latency is the speed at which it spins the disc to find the location of the data, whereas the transfer rate is the speed at which the data is transfered to and from the disk media. Therefore, both affect the speed of information being transfered, but latency is the speed of getting to the data versus transfer is the speed of sending the data. 
SSD, or Solid State Drives, have the same function as hard drives, storage of information and data, but they are newer and have a different way of storing and retrieving the information that is faster and more reliable than hard drives. Solid state drives do not use the spinning platters or moving heads in order to store and retrieve data, rather, they use flash memory and store data in the memory by splitting it into word length pieces.
Increasing RAM allows the computer to run faster as it is less likely to not be able to hold all of the data, meaning that it is less likely to need to use the slower path of switching data in and out of the hard drive in order to complete the actions needed. Therefore, by increasing the about of RAM memory, more data is loaded into the RAM which is faster than the hard drive and thus doesn't need to access the hard drive as much, so it will be faster.
The differnce between 64 and 32 bit data paths is the number of bits which they can transfer per 1 clock cycle, as 64 bit data paths like ones used in DIMMs can transfer 64 bits in 1 clock cycle, whereas 32 bit data paths like ones in SIMMs can only transfer 32 bits of data in 1 clock cycle.
