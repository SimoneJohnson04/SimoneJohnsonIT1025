### Executive Summary
Executive summary stuff (summary as if explaining it to a team)


### Information System Components  
An example of an information system that I used just a few hours ago is a Google Forms survey in order to conduct an election (for marching band). The system allowed users to input their votes for one canidate per position and then processed the data in order to display it easily for the person conducting the election.

**Hardware** - The hardware in this voting system is the computers, phones, keyboards, mice, and tablets that people used to vote and access the results.

**Software** - Two components of software in the information system of this voting process are the operating system and the application software. The operating system  could be ChromeOS, which Chromebooks use, Apple iOS which is used by iPhones, or Google Andriod for Andriod phones. The application software is Google Forms, created by Google.

**Data** - The data in this information system is the votes for each candidate, as the data that the survey is collecting is the votes in order to analyze the results

**People** - The people in this infomation system are the person who created the Google Form, and the developers, testers, analysts, and everyone else behind the creation of the Google Form application, along with all of the people who filled out the Google Form.

**Processes** - The processes in this information system are the collection and compilation of the responses by the application (Google Forms) and the utilization of that information in order to determine the results of the election and this allows the users to get the information they need from the information system in order to use it to promote the correct candidate.


### GitHub  
#### Client-Server Architecture  
GitHub is a "Client-Server" archeticture because it has the user log on and connect to the server and the computer that the user is considered the client and it communicates with the server. A client-side application is one that the action is taking place on the client or user's computer, as opposed to server-side which are actions on the web server. One action that is done client-side is the interpretation of mark-up languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS, whereas an action such as data storage or interpretation of other programming languages like Java, Ruby, or Python is usually done on the server-side. What GitHub Desktop does to the client-server arceticture is that the client is downloaded onto the computer as an application rather than being on a website, but both need to communicate with the server.
#### Cloud Computing
"Cloud computing" is computer services such as servers, storage, analytics, and databases being sent to the client's computer by way the "cloud" or internet. GitHub is considered "cloud computing" because it provides storage for information and allows the client's computer to connect to the server and potentially download software. An example of another "cloud computing" environment I use is Google Drive as it uses servers in order to deliver information and store information for the client.
