## Python IDLE
Python shell is a place where code runs immidiately, but it also doesn't save the code, whereas the file editor in the IDLE allows you to create, edit, and save programs and it uses the Python shell in order to run the program. Essentially, python shell is where the code runs and code can be programmed there, but it doesn't save, while the file editor in the IDLE lets you save programs then run them in the shell.
### Code Examples
**Variables** - A variable is a location in which a value can be stored, and the author uses the names spam, bacon and eggs because they are very specific and tell the reader of the code what the value represents, but more specifically they were inspired by the Monty Python “Spam” sketch. An example of a variable would be "Chickens".
**Assignment Statements** -  An assignment statement is a statement in the code that gives a variable a set value, usually using the "=" operator. An example would be "Chickens = input()"
**Functions** - Functions in python are a set of statements that take an input and then go through the statements and put out an output. An example of this is "int(Chickens)", turning the string into an integer.
**Three Data Types** - The three data types are integers, which are whole numbers like 1, floating point numbers also known as doubles like 4.56, and strings which are like words like 'hello'.
## Graphics
### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster graphics are images that are made up of very many small pixels, and the pixels aren't seen unless zoomed in quite a bit. On the other hand, vector graphics are images that don't lose quality as you zoom in as they are made of something more complex than pixels, called geometry. Raster graphics are better for times in which customers aren't going to be zooming in as they are easier to find or make, but vector graphics are better for times when high quality will be needed for zooming in, such as a digital photography blog.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless compression saves all of the data from the original image, whereas lossy compression removes some of the data by merging colors that are similar to each other making the file less large but losing some of the data. Lossy compression is used when space is a bigger factor than quality, that is, it is more important that the file is smaller than the photo is high quality. However, in graphic design it is often more important that the quality is high so they use lossless compression which has a larger file but higher quality images.
### File Formats
A jpg file is one that uses lossy compression in order to save file space, however, it lets the developer specify how much compression they want, allowing them to control the compression vs size ratio. A gif file is one that allows for animated images, along with the fact that it is a bitmap image format, allowing up to 8 bits per pixel. On the other hand, a png is a format that uses lossless file compression to store images, but it is less commonly used despite its ability to have transparent backgrounds.
### File Properties
My image took 5 "layers", one for each of the objects. In my design, the layers are as follows: the green arrow, the text box saying "up", the text box saying "scale images", the box around the text in white and red, and the red background box. The main feature I wanted in the design was the arrow pointing upwards in order to emphasize the "up" part. The file is 203 KB, ad the option that my computer recommends joining with is chrome.exe, meaning that it opens the image in a web browser. This isn't the most optimal location because most times you don't want to see the image in a new tab, rather, the "Photos" application on Chromebooks would be much more optimal for this task.
