## Python IDLE
Python shell is a place where code runs immidiately, but it also doesn't save the code, whereas the file editor in the IDLE allows you to create, edit, and save programs and it uses the Python shell in order to run the program. Essentially, python shell is where the code runs and code can be programmed there, but it doesn't save, while the file editor in the IDLE lets you save programs then run them in the shell.
### Code Examples
**Variables** - A variable is a location in which a value can be stored, and the author uses the names spam, bacon and eggs because they are very specific and tell the reader of the code what the value represents, but more specifically they were inspired by the Monty Python “Spam” sketch. An example of a variable would be "Chickens".
**Assignment Statements** -  An assignment statement is a statement in the code that gives a variable a set value, usually using the "=" operator. An example would be "Chickens = input()"
**Functions** - Functions in python are a set of statements that take an input and then go through the statements and put out an output. An example of this is "int(Chickens)", turning the string into an integer.
**Three Data Types** - The three data types are integers, which are whole numbers like 1, floating point numbers also known as doubles like 4.56, and strings which are like words like 'hello'.
