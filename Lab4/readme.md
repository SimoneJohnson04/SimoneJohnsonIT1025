## Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Information Systems Security
**Information Security Triad CIA** - As a part of the amazon.com online chat, the confidentiality aspect would affect my job because what is said in the chat by the customer would be kept confidential (not telling others about it), unless the someone that needs to know requests it by the proper protocols. The integrity portion can be seen as the employee needs to honestly chart and document the issues in the chat and not make up data or discount the customer based on their own biases. Avaliability comes into play when the company has to make sure that customers can access the help they need and the employees in the chat can access the data they need in order to help the customer.
**Authentification** - Three tasks that require authentification are signing into Gmail, logining into Blackboard, and turning on (getting into) your phone. You could make these into multi-factor identification by making Gmail require you to verify from your phone via a text that contains a code that it is you, Blackboard requiring you to input a code from an email, or your phone using both your password and your FaceId in order to turn it on.
**ACL & RBAC** - ACL, or Access Control List, allows a manager to give each user certain permissions, and this is simple and easy to understand, but it can be tedious as each individual is done seperately. On the other hand, RBAC, or Role Based Access Control, is more complex as it assigns employees roles and then assigns roles certain permissions, but it allows more security and easier control over who has permissions.
**Ciphers** - Cipher text is what the encoded data sent to the customer's computer is called, as the data is encrypted using a cipher. The public key is what is used by your computer in order to send an encrypted message to another computer. A private key is what the computer that receives the message uses in order to decode the text.
**Public Key Necessity** - We need public key cryptology because it allows companies and individuals to send information to each other without having to create a shared code and without the worry that someone else will be able to intercept their data.
### Cryptography
**Caesar Cipher** - The Caesar cipher is a cipher in which the letters are all shifted by the same amount, however it is not the most secure type of cipher as it can be easily solved by brute force.
**Frequency Fingerprint Exploration** - The result of this is that the most common letters used in English are E, T, and A, and with the longer the message, the more likely that is to be true. However, with different languages this will not be exactly the same as the words have different frequencies and some languages have letters the English doesn't have, such as ll, rr, and Ã± in Spanish.
**Polyalphabetic Cipher** - A polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher that has a lighter fingerprint by using a whole word in order to shift rather than just one letter, however there is still the possibility of breaking into it.
**Polyalphabetic Cipher Exploration** - The result of the exploration is that this cipher is much more safe than the caesar cipher, and that the longer the shift word the more difficult it is to figure out what the message was originally.
### Brute-Force
Brute force is using a computer program (or extereme effort) to figure out the message without having the key for the cipher. It relates to Kerckhoffs's principle because it proves that it is neccessary to have a system that is secure so that even if everyone knows how to perform the cipher, the information that it contains is still safe.
