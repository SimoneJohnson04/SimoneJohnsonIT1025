## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The methods and properties of the shark are swim and be awesome in the example. The purpose of a constructor is to initalize data or a class object. A class is a blueprint of an object that gives basic characteristics and methods, whereas an object is an instance of that class and can have more specific characteristics. Instantiating an object is when a programmer creates an instnace of a class, for example the class could be humans, and the programmer instantiates an object when he creates Joe, an object of the class human.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
OMG, or Object Management Group, is an international nonprofit organization that makes standards for technology and oversees specifications of UML. The purpose of UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is to be a commonly used modeling language in order to better archetecture, design, and to improve visual modeling.
**Object** - Sammy. This is because Sammy was an instance of the blueprint "shark". 
**Class** - shark. This is because the class that was created was called shark and it is the general category under which the objects are made. 
**Abstraction** - a specific type of shark. This is because abstraction is giving details to an object that the general class doesn't specify. 
**Encapsulation** - Definition of a shark. This is because it defines a shark as such and such and prevents the other sharks from changing the general class. 
**Inheritance** - swim(). This is because the objects inherit this method from the class.


## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Relational Data
Data is raw facts without context, and information is processed data with context, whereas knowledge is perceptions about relationships among facts.
The primary key would be the customers id based upon a credit card number. The customers and orders tables would be related because they would represent which customer has ordered which item. The foreign key in the orders table would be the item that they ordered as it connects the orders table to the customers table.
### Big Data
The four V's of big data are: Volume (Amount/mass quantity of the data being recorded), Variety(The different types of data that is being recorded), Veracity(How accurate/trustworthy the data is, how significant a change is), and Velocity(Motion/time since past data influx).
Technologies such as computers, phones, and other devices along with the internet allow big data to flow into programs, and then these programs need to be able to collect and interpret this large quantity of data that they are receiving.
