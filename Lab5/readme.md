# Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 5 was to learn more about Python via Object Oriented Programming, learn about data tables and SQL, and to consider ethical dilemnas that may be encountered in the field of computing and intellectual properties. Through the lab, Python skills were expanded upon by using the concept of Object Oriented Programming and how UML can be used to model this type of programming. Additionally, relationships between data and how to use SQL to analyze these databases was featured prominently in this lab. Finally, this lab touched on how ethics are enforced and how information and intellectual properties are regulated.


## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The methods and properties of the shark are swim and be awesome in the example. The purpose of a constructor is to initalize data or a class object. A class is a blueprint of an object that gives basic characteristics and methods, whereas an object is an instance of that class and can have more specific characteristics. Instantiating an object is when a programmer creates an instnace of a class, for example the class could be humans, and the programmer instantiates an object when he creates Joe, an object of the class human.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
OMG, or Object Management Group, is an international nonprofit organization that makes standards for technology and oversees specifications of UML. The purpose of UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is to be a commonly used modeling language in order to better archetecture, design, and to improve visual modeling.
**Object** - Sammy. This is because Sammy was an instance of the blueprint "shark". 
**Class** - shark. This is because the class that was created was called shark and it is the general category under which the objects are made. 
**Abstraction** - a specific type of shark. This is because abstraction is giving details to an object that the general class doesn't specify. 
**Encapsulation** - Definition of a shark. This is because it defines a shark as such and such and prevents the other sharks from changing the general class. 
**Inheritance** - swim(). This is because the objects inherit this method from the class.


## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Relational Data
Data is raw facts without context, and information is processed data with context, whereas knowledge is perceptions about relationships among facts.
The primary key would be the customers id based upon a credit card number. The customers and orders tables would be related because they would represent which customer has ordered which item. The foreign key in the orders table would be the item that they ordered as it connects the orders table to the customers table.
### Big Data
The four V's of big data are: Volume (Amount/mass quantity of the data being recorded), Variety(The different types of data that is being recorded), Veracity(How accurate/trustworthy the data is, how significant a change is), and Velocity(Motion/time since past data influx).
Technologies such as computers, phones, and other devices along with the internet allow big data to flow into programs, and then these programs need to be able to collect and interpret this large quantity of data that they are receiving.


## Structured Query Language (SQL)
RBDMS, or Relational Database Management System, relates to SQL because RBDMS is a system that allows for data to be input and stored, along with the data to be analyzed for relationships, and SQL uses this in order to query and modify the data that is stored in the RDBMS. The two tabes I choose were the customers table and the orders table. The primary key for the customers table was the customer ID, and the foreign key for the orders table is the customer ID and the primary key for the orders table is the order ID. They are related because the customers ID listed in the customers table was recorded as the foreign key in the orders table.


## SQL Injections
SQL injections are a security threat because they are codes that can cause the webpage to run an SQL statement on their database, which can allow the user who input the SQL injection to access all of the usernames and passwords stored in the database, which clearly poses a threat to online security. An example of something that can be done in order to reduce the threat that SQL injections pose is by using SQL parameters in order to make sure that the input is treated as such, and not as an SQL code.

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
The purpose of a code of ethics is that it provides an outline of what behaviors are considered ethical, and which are considered unethical. ACM created a code of ethics for the computing disciplin because it allowed them to have a set of guidelines as to what is ethical and unethical, such as admonition to be honest and trustworthy, not using others software without permission, and leaders improving the workplace, not degrading it. The difference between a code of ethics and Acceptable Use Policy is that AUPs generally have power to enforce what they determine to be ethical and unethical as they can remove resources if the policy is violated. An AUP that is particularily relevant to my life is the AUP at my high school (http://portal.solonschools.org/Welcome/Registration/TechUse.pdf). One of the parts of the policy that I find interesting is #6 of the unauthorized uses: "Any attempts to access any resources, features, contents or controls of the technology resources that
are restricted, confidential or privileged." I find this particularily interesting because I believe that often the school attempts to control and restrict too many resources, because many times our teachers will post videos for assignments that we have to complete and those sites will be restricted and attempting to access them will technically be against the AUP.
### Intellectual Property
The purpose of WIPO is to protect intellectual properties worldwide and to increase communication and cooperation among the Unions established by the treaties that WIPO oversees, and the importance of WIPO is that they protect the intellectual properties by copywriting the creations. Technically, as soon as you create an original work , you have a copyright on it, however if you want it to be used commercially or to sue someone for using it, you have to register the work with the US Copyright Office. It might be important to copyright the SVG if you think that someone else will use it commercially without your permission because if the copyright isn't registered, you can not sue them. The role of a trademark is to prevent others from creating or using something very similar that might cause confusion to customers.
### Information Collection
COPPA (Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act), FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), and HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) all protect online privacy by resticting the rights of the websites to collect information about the users. COPPA prevents websites and apps from collecting data from children under the age of thirteen without parental consent. FERPA prevents the distribution of student information past the age of 18 or in post-high school education to the parents without the permission of the student. Lastly, HIPPA prevents the doctors from disclosing medical information online and ensures the privacy of the patients medical records.


## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned more about how OOP works and I expect that this will continue to help me in the future as one of the languages that I use more commonly outside of this course is Java, in which OOP can also be implemented. Additionally, I enjoyed learning about how data can be used to draw conclusions and how SQL can be used to halp analyze and enter data into a database. Finally, I found it interesting how intellectual properties work and how information collection is regulated by multiple organizations. Overall, this course helped me learn more about how technology works in our everyday lives and how it will continue to affect our futures moving forward.
