## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The methods and properties of the shark are swim and be awesome in the example. The purpose of a constructor is to initalize data or a class object. A class is a blueprint of an object that gives basic characteristics and methods, whereas an object is an instance of that class and can have more specific characteristics. Instantiating an object is when a programmer creates an instnace of a class, for example the class could be humans, and the programmer instantiates an object when he creates Joe, an object of the class human.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
OMG, or Object Management Group, is an international nonprofit organization that makes standards for technology and oversees specifications of UML. The purpose of UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is to be a commonly used modeling language in order to better archetecture, design, and to improve visual modeling.
**Object** - Sammy. This is because Sammy was an instance of the blueprint "shark". 
**Class** - shark. This is because the class that was created was called shark and it is the general category under which the objects are made. 
**Abstraction** - a specific type of shark. This is because abstraction is giving details to an object that the general class doesn't specify. 
**Encapsulation** - Definition of a shark. This is because it defines a shark as such and such and prevents the other sharks from changing the general class. 
**Inheritance** - swim(). This is because the objects inherit this method from the class.
